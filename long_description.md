Bheka is a **Pybossa application**.

It's purpose is to prepare work for mappers.

The idea is to help determine rapidly whether there's mapping work to do
Users are shown a small aerial imagery and are asked the following question:
**Do you see any building or road in this image?**

The application provides three simple answers as action buttons:

  * Yes
  * No and
  * I don't know (imagery is too bad)

Based on the answer of the users, we will be able to classify the images, so
that other users can do the mapping job via an other tool (ie. the HOT Tasking
Manager).

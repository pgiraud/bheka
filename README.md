# bheka
A micro tasking PyBossa infrastructures recognition project to help create Tasking Manager projects

I was looking for a short and pretty name. I searched for a translation for `see`, `perceive`. The one in Zoulou `Bheka` was perfect.

Inspiration comes from the [Kuona project](https://github.com/nicolas17/kuona)
and more recently from a [Pybossa application written by
Benni](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/pedrito1414/diary/35401) from
Disasters Mappers.

# Purpose

This project is all one need to create a project in `PyBossa`.

The main goal is to show a `Bing` imagery tile to the user in order to tell if there's a building or a road within the image.

It needs to be fast and easy so that users can do a lot of tasks in a limited amount of time.

# Installation

This is a `PyBossa` project. To install it you'll have to follow the instructions provided in `PyBossa` documentation.
